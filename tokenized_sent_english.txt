Fentanil: ['At recommended doses, fentanyl can cause side effects, notably respiratory depression, apnea, muscle stiffness and bradycardia.', 'other reported side effects include hypotension, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting and sweating.', 'other less frequently observed side effects are: laryngospasm, allergic reactions (such as anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, itching, urticaria) and asystole.', 'As several medications are administered concomitantly during anesthesia, it is not known whether these effects have a causal relationship with fentanyl.', 'In rare circumstances, secondary rebound respiratory depression has been observed after surgery.', 'respiratory depression can be easily controlled by the use of assisted ventilation, and is quickly and completely neutralized by the use of an effective antidote, such as naloxone hydrochloride.', 'Vagotropic-type effects such as hypotension, bradycardia and bronchospasm can be completely reversible with the administration of atropine.', 'When a neuroleptic such as droperidol is used with fentanyl, the following side effects may be observed: fever and/or tremor, agitation, postoperative hallucination episodes and extrapyramidal symptoms.', 'warnings: as with other CNS depressants, patients under the influence of fentanyl must receive adequate medical supervision and must have resuscitation equipment and narcotic antagonist available.', "Hyperventilation during anesthesia can alter the patient's response to CO2, thus affecting breathing in the postoperative period.", 'In the postoperative period, when there is a need for analgesics with narcotic activity, the total dose of fentanyl already administered must be kept in mind.', 'As the respiratory depressant effect of fentanyl may extend beyond the duration of its analgesic effect, doses of narcotic analgesics should be reduced to 1/3 of those usually recommended.', 'Fentanyl can cause muscle stiffness, particularly compromising the muscles of breathing and during the induction of anesthesia.', 'it can also affect skeletal muscle movements of various groups in the extremities, neck and eyeball.', 'These effects are related to the dose and injection speed and the incidence can be reduced through the use of benzodiazepines, premedication or curative agents or neuromuscular blockers.', 'Non-epileptic myoclonic movements may occur once muscle rigidity is established.', 'breathing, however, must be assisted or controlled.', "It should be borne in mind that the use of neuromuscular blocking agents must be compatible with the patient's cardiovascular status.", 'Bradycardia and possibly asystole may occur if the patient has received an insufficient amount of anticholinergic or when fentanyl is combined with non-vagolytic muscle relaxants.', 'Opioids can induce hypotension, especially in hypovolemic patients.', 'therefore, appropriate measures must be taken to maintain stable blood pressure.', 'Fentanyl may also cause other signs and symptoms characteristic of narcotic analgesics, including euphoria, miosis, bradycardia and bronchoconstriction.', 'Fentanyl should be administered with caution, particularly in patients at increased risk of respiratory depression such as those comatose from head trauma or brain tumor.', 'In these patients, the transient reduction in mean arterial pressure has occasionally been accompanied by a brief reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure.', '- drug interactions: the concomitant use of fentanyl with other central nervous system depressants (for example: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, other narcotics or general anesthetic agents and alcohol) will provide additive or potentiating effects.', 'In these cases, the dose of fentanyl should be reduced alternatively.', 'After administration of fentanyl, the dose of other CNS depressants should be reduced.', 'An unpredictable and intense potentiation of MAO inhibitors by narcotic analgesics has been described.', 'therefore, patients using these inhibitors should have their administration suspended for at least 2 weeks before receiving fentanyl.', 'dependence and abuse of medication: fentanyl is a product that contains a controlled substance that can cause morphine dependence and has the potential for abuse.', 'Due to the characteristics of the substance, its use is restricted to anesthetic indications and under the care and guidance of a qualified professional.', '- use in children: the safety of fentanyl in children under 2 years of age has not yet been established.', '- use in pregnancy: the safety of fentanyl in relation to possible adverse effects on fetal development has not yet been determined.', 'therefore, it should be used during pregnancy only when, in medical judgment, the benefits outweigh the possible risks.', '- use during lactation: fentanyl can pass into breast milk, therefore, it is not recommended to breastfeed for a period of 24 hours after administration of fentanyl.', 'Effects on the ability to drive and operate machines: Patients will only be able to drive and operate machines if sufficient time has elapsed after administration of fentanyl.', 'warnings and precautions what should I know before using?', 'The initial dose of fentanyl should be reduced in elderly and debilitated patients, according to each case.', 'Fentanyl is recommended for use in anesthesiology and should not be used except in surgical centers equipped with adequate equipment and with indicated antidotes when applied in the neuroleptoanalgesia technique.', 'associated with droperidol and possibly complemented by nitrogen protoxide, curatives or other agents, the simultaneous administration of other neuroleptics or morphine analgesics is inadvisable.', 'when used in labor with a live fetus there is the possibility of crossing the placental barrier and causing depression of the fetal respiratory center, which is why its use must be carried out with caution by anesthetists with experience in this technique.', 'the recommended dose should not be exceeded in order to avoid possible respiratory depression and muscle hypertonia.', 'The possibility that nitrogen protoxide causes cardiovascular depression has been reported when administered with high doses of fentanyl.', 'When used as a supplement to regional anesthesia, the anesthetist must bear in mind that this type of anesthesia can cause respiratory depression due to blockage of the intercostal nerves, a depression that can be potentiated by fentanyl used in association with tranquilizers such as droperidol.', 'Hypotension may occur and must be controlled with appropriate measures, including, if necessary, the use of pressor agents other than adrenaline.', 'droperidol can induce the appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms that can be controlled by antiparkinsonian agents.', 'Fentanyl should be used with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other pathologies that reduce respiratory capacity during anesthesia, this can be resolved through assisted or controlled breathing.', 'It must be taken into account that the respiratory depression caused by fentanyl may be longer than the duration of the effect of the narcotic antagonist used, and appropriate medical care must therefore be maintained.', 'Patients on chronic opioid therapy or with a history of opioid abuse may require higher doses of fentanyl.', 'Fentanyl should be administered with caution to patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and alcoholism.', 'Fentanyl can cause bradycardia, which, although reversed by atropine, requires its use with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmia.', 'overdose: manifestations of fentanyl overdose are an extension of its pharmacological action.', 'treatment: if hypoventilation or apnea occurs, oxygen must be administered and breathing must be assisted or controlled as appropriate.', 'A free airway must be maintained, if necessary using an intratracheal cannula.', 'If there is an association of respiratory depression with muscle stiffness, the use of a curative may be necessary.', 'the patient must be carefully observed for 24 hours; body temperature and fluid replacement must be adequately maintained.', 'If hypotension is marked and persistent, the possibility of hypovolemia must be taken into account, which must be corrected with the parenteral administration of appropriate solutions.', 'A specific antagonist, such as naloxone hydrochloride, must be available to control respiratory depression.', 'Ultimately, all necessary measures must be taken.', 'It should not be forgotten that the respiratory depression caused by fentanyl may be longer than the duration of the narcotic antagonist effect used.']

the additional adverse experience was dry socket after tooth extraction.', 'In the study of pain after orthopedic surgery, the most commonly reported adverse experiences were constipation, fever, and nausea.', 'warnings and precautions what should I know before using?', 'Vioxx treatment is not recommended for patients with advanced kidney disease.', 'There is no clinical experience involving patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min.', 'If Vioxx treatment is necessary in such patients, close monitoring of their renal function is recommended.', 'Renal prostaglandins may play a compensatory role in maintaining renal perfusion.', 'therefore, when renal perfusion is compromised, the administration of vioxx may reduce the formation of prostaglandins and, secondarily, renal blood flow, thus compromising renal function.', 'The risk of such a response is greater in those patients with pre-existing significant impairment of renal function, uncompensated heart failure, or cirrhosis.', 'monitoring of renal function should be considered in these patients.', 'Like other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, discontinuation of vioxx treatment would be expected to be followed by a return to pre-treatment conditions.', 'Caution should be taken when initiating treatment with Vioxx in patients with considerable dehydration.', 'In this case, it is advisable to rehydrate patients before starting Vioxx therapy.', 'Like other drugs known to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins, water retention and edema have been observed in some patients receiving Vioxx.', 'In clinical studies, the frequency of these episodes was similar to that observed with non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors and, in general, they were transient, not requiring treatment discontinuation.', 'the possibility of water retention or edema should be considered when vioxx is used in patients with pre-existing edema or heart failure.', 'despite clinical studies involving vioxx 25 mg or 50 mg demonstrating similarity with placebo in terms of the incidence of ulcers detected by endoscopy after 12 weeks, and a combined analysis of eight studies (treatment with vioxx 12.5 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg) demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract perforations, ulcers or bleeding (pubs) than in patients treated with non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors during up to 12 months of treatment, there was indeed an occurrence of upper gastrointestinal tract ulcers, perforations and bleeding. upper gastrointestinal tract in patients with osteoarthritis (oa) treated with vioxx or placebo.', 'therefore, clinicians should be aware that certain patients may develop perforations, ulcers, or bleeds (pubs) regardless of treatment, but that the risk is lower in patients treated with Vioxx relative to patients treated with non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors.', 'Regardless of treatment, patients with a history of pubs and patients over 65 years of age appear to be at increased risk of pubs.', 'In clinical studies involving Vioxx, increases in alt and/or ast (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) were reported.', 'the incidence of increased alt and/or ast in patients treated with vioxx 12.5 mg and 25 mg was similar to that observed in patients treated with ibuprofen, but notably lower than that observed in the group treated with diclofenac.', 'These changes disappeared in patients treated with Vioxx and, in about half of the cases, without interruption of treatment.', 'A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver function test has been observed, should be evaluated for persistently abnormal liver function tests.', 'If this is detected (results three times the upper limit of normal), vioxx should be discontinued.', 'Vioxx should be used with caution in patients who have already experienced acute attacks of asthma, urticaria or rhinitis, caused by the use of salicylates or non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors.', 'Since the pathophysiology of these reactions is unknown, clinicians must weigh the potential benefits of prescribing Vioxx against the possible risks.', 'Vioxx can mask fever, which is a sign of infection.', 'the physician should be aware of this possibility when using Vioxx in patients treated for infection.', '- pregnancy: like other drugs that are known to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins, the use of vioxx should be avoided at the end of pregnancy because it can cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.', 'There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.', 'Vioxx should only be used during the first two trimesters of pregnancy if the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.', '- nursing mothers: it is not known whether rofecoxib is excreted in human milk.', 'Since many drugs are excreted in human milk and in view of the possible adverse effects of those that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in infants, the importance of medication for the mother must be considered when deciding whether to discontinue breastfeeding or medication.', '- pediatric use: safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.', '- use in the elderly: pharmacokinetics in elderly patients (65 years of age or older) are similar to those in young individuals.', 'In general, no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly and younger patients in clinical studies; other reported clinical experience did not identify differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.', '- drug interactions: in individuals stabilized on chronic treatment with warfarin, the administration of 25 mg of vioxx per day was associated with an increase in prothrombin time of approximately 8% (international normalized ratio-inr).', 'This is unlikely to be clinically important for most patients and it is not necessary to change the routine prothrombin time monitoring required during warfarin therapy.', 'coadministration of vioxx and rifampicin reduced rofecoxib plasma concentrations by approximately 50%.', 'therefore, when Vioxx is administered together with rifampin, consideration should be given to using the highest recommended dose of Vioxx.', 'vioxx 75 mg (dose 3 to 6 times higher than those recommended for osteoarthritis) administered once daily for 10 days increased plasma concentrations of methotrexate (aucdn4 (0-24 h)) by 23% in patients with arthritis rheumatoid patients who received 7.5 to 15 mg/week of methotrexate.', 'Twenty-four hours after administration, a similar proportion of patients treated with methotrexate alone and subsequently treated with methotrexate and 75 mg rofecoxib had methotrexate plasma concentrations below the measurable limit (5 ng/ml).', 'The effects of recommended doses of Vioxx on methotrexate plasma levels are unknown.', 'Appropriate monitoring for methotrexate-related toxicity should be considered when vioxx and methotrexate are administered concomitantly.', 'in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 25 mg per day of vioxx and an ACE inhibitor (benazepril 10 mg to 40 mg per day) for 4 weeks was associated with a slight attenuation of the antihypertensive effect (mean increase of 2.8 mmHg in mean arterial pressure) compared to the ACE inhibitor alone.', 'This interaction should be considered in patients treated with Vioxx and ACE inhibitors concomitantly.', 'Vioxx can be used with low doses of aspirin.', 'At steady state, vioxx 50 mg once daily had no effect on the antiplatelet activity of low-dose aspirin (81 mg once daily).', 'Furthermore, no clinically important differences were observed between aspirin users and non-aspirin users in the overall incidence of clinical adverse experiences.', 'Since it has no effects on platelets, Vioxx is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.', 'In drug interaction studies, vioxx did not exert clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: prednisone/prednisolone, oral contraceptives (ethinyl

other fibrates and with lipid-lowering doses (>1 g/ day) of niacin (nicotinic acid).', 'Furthermore, the risk of myopathy appears to increase with high levels of hmg-coa reductase inhibitory activity in plasma.', 'Lovastatin and other hmg-coa reductase inhibitors are metabolized by cytochrome p450 isoform 3a4.', 'Certain drugs that in therapeutic doses have a significant inhibitory effect on this

most cases, when patients immediately discontinued treatment, muscle symptoms and increases in ck disappeared.', 'Of the patients with rhabdomyolysis, many had a complicated clinical history.', 'some had pre-existing renal failure, usually as a consequence of long-standing diabetes.', 'in such patients, dose increases require caution.', 'Likewise, as there are no known adverse consequences of briefly interrupting therapy during certain periods, treatment with lovastatin should be suspended a few days before major elective surgery and upon the appearance of any serious acute condition, medical or surgical.', 'measures to reduce the risk of myopathy caused by drug interactions.', 'When considering combining lovastatin and any of the drugs that interact with it, clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor their patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, soreness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy. and during periods of upward dose titration of each drug.', 'Periodic ck determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no guarantee that such monitoring will prevent myopathy.', 'The combined use of lovastatin with fibrates or niacin should be avoided unless the benefit of additional changes in lipid levels outweighs the increased risks of this drug combination.', 'Combinations of fibrates or niacin with low doses of lovastatin have been used without the occurrence of myopathy in small, short-term and adequately monitored clinical studies.', 'The addition of these drugs to hmg-coa reductase inhibitors typically provides very slight additional reductions in LDL cholesterol, but additional reductions in triglycerides and additional increases in HDL cholesterol can be achieved.', 'If one of these drugs must be used with lovastatin, clinical experience suggests that the risk of myopathy is lower with niacin than with fibrates.', 'In patients concomitantly receiving cyclosporine, fibrates or niacin, the dose of lovastatin should generally not exceed 20 mg, as the risk of myopathy increases substantially with higher doses.', 'interruption of lovastatin therapy during treatment with a systemic azole antifungal or a macrolide antibiotic should be considered.', 'Concomitant use with other medications that in therapeutic doses are known to have a significant inhibitory effect on cytochrome p450 3a4 should be avoided unless the benefits of combined therapy outweigh the increased risk.', 'hepatic effects: in the first clinical studies, important increases in transaminases (greater than 3 times the lsn) occurred in a few patients, generally after 3 to 12 months of starting therapy with mevacor, but without the development of jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms.', 'there was no evidence of hypersensitivity.', 'A liver biopsy was performed on one of these patients and mild focal hepatitis was found.', 'some of these patients had altered liver function before the introduction of lovastatin and/or consumed considerable amounts of alcohol.', 'in patients in whom therapy was interrupted or suspended because of increased transaminases, including the patient who underwent biopsy, transaminase levels slowly returned to pretreatment levels.', 'It is recommended that transaminases be measured before starting treatment and periodically during treatment, especially in patients who have abnormal liver function tests and/or who consume substantial amounts of alcohol, and in patients in whom the dose is increased. to 40 mg/day or more.', 'If transaminases rise above 3 times the lsn, the potential risk of continuing treatment with mevacor must be weighed against the benefits expected from its use.', 'transaminase measurements must be repeated immediately; if increases are persistent or progressive, the drug should be discontinued.', 'As with other lipid-lowering agents, moderate increases in transaminases (less than 3 times the lsn) have been reported during mevacor therapy.', 'These changes appeared shortly after starting Mevacor therapy, were generally transient and were not accompanied by any symptoms; it was not necessary to interrupt treatment.', 'The drug should be used with caution in patients with a history of liver disease.', 'Active liver disease is a contraindication for the use of Mevacor.', 'ophthalmological evaluations: even in the absence of any drug therapy, it is predictable that over time there will be an increase in the prevalence of lens opacities as a result of aging.', 'Current data from long-term clinical studies do not indicate adverse effects of lovastatin on the lens of humans.', 'pregnancy: mevacor is contraindicated in pregnancy.', 'Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering agents during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia.', 'Furthermore, cholesterol and other products of cholesterol biosynthesis are essential components for fetal development, including the synthesis of steroids and cell membranes.', 'Due to the ability of hmg-coa reductase inhibitors, such as mevacor, to decrease the synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other products of the biosynthetic chain, mevacor is contraindicated in pregnancy.', 'mevacor should be administered to fertile women only when these patients have no minimal chance of conceiving.', 'If the patient becomes pregnant while using the drug, mevacor must be discontinued immediately and the patient must be informed of the possible risks to the fetus.', 'As safety in pregnant women has not been established and there is no apparent benefit to mevacor therapy during pregnancy, treatment should be immediately discontinued upon confirmation of pregnancy.', 'nursing mothers: it is not known whether mevacor is excreted in human milk.', 'Because many drugs are excreted in milk and because of their potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, patients using mevacor should not breastfeed their infants.', '- pediatric use: safety and efficacy in children have not been established.', 'elderly: in a controlled study in elderly patients over 60 years of age, efficacy appeared to be similar to that observed in the general population and there was no apparent increase in the frequency of adverse clinical and laboratory findings.', 'Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: In patients with the rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, Mevacor is less effective, possibly because these patients do not have functional LDL receptors.', 'mevacor appears to more frequently cause transaminase increases in these homozygous patients.', 'hypertriglyceridemia: mevacor has a moderate triglyceride-lowering effect and is not indicated when hypertriglyceridemia is the most important abnormality (i.e., hyperlipidemia types i, iv and v).', '- drug interactions: the risk of rhabdomyolysis increases with the concomitant use of mevacor with drugs that, in therapeutic doses, have a significant inhibitory effect on cytochrome p450 3a4, such as cyclosporine, mibefradil, itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin and nefazodone or with derivatives of fibric acid or niacin.', 'coumarin derivatives: when lovastatin and coumarin anticoagulants are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time may increase in some patients.', 'It is recommended to determine the prothrombin time of patients receiving anticoagulants before starting therapy with lovastatin and whenever necessary during the first days of therapy, to ensure that no significant changes in prothrombin time occur.', 'Once a stable prothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be monitored at intervals typically recommended for patients treated with coumarin anticoagulants.', 'If the dose of lovastatin is changed, the same procedure must be
